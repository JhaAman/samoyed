Answer text:
The main difference is that static site generation is compiled or built only once for multiple users, whereas server side rendering is built when the user navigates to that webpage.

Server side rendering is best for a dashboard, perhaps, where you'd want to populate the data before the user can see anything. Static site generation is best for landing pages, blog posts and other content that doesn't change often and is the same for every user.
